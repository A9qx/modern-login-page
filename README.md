# Modern Login Page

I have designed a login page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that is not only modern but also highly responsive.

## How to Use:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hVSshjh.png"  width="60%" height="30%">

To ensure that the HTML file loads correctly and to facilitate ease of editing, it is imperative to **use a Web Server**, such as the one available in VSCode, as **opposed to simply opening the file in Chrome**, as the latter may result in incorrect loading and cause unnecessary difficulties during the editing process.

## Login Credentials
Username: ``A9qx``

Password: ``andr@asistheG@0t``

(I would recommend copy and pasting this in)!

## Features:

 - Modern UI
 - Gradient that fades into different colors
 - Responsive Login
 - Easy to Use
