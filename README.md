# Modern Login Page

I have designed a login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is not only modern but also highly responsive.

## How to Use:

To ensure that the HTML file loads correctly and to facilitate ease of editing, it is imperative to use a Web Server, such as the one available in VSCode, as opposed to simply opening the file in Chrome, as the latter may result in incorrect loading and cause unnecessary difficulties during the editing process.

## Login Credentials
Username: ``A9qx``

Password: ``andr@asistheG@0t``

(I would recommend copy and pasting this in)
